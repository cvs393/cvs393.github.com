# stylus_website
created a website for my school's student run magazine using html, css, javascript. currently working on the submissions page and gallery page. pictures for backgrounds are not mine. 

# Documentation for editing / downloading: 
Here’s the documentation for the project for you to have it working and installed on your laptop in case you want to change anything or completely remake the website. 


1. Make a github account at github.com. 
2. Go to https://github.com/cvs393/stylus_website
3. Click on ‘Clone/Download’ and click on the HTTPS link. This will copy the link. 
4. Install git bash onto your computer at https://gitforwindows.org/ 
5. After successfully installing, open your cmd line. This can by done on Linux by pressing CMD + Space and then typing ‘terminal’, or pressing the Window key + R and then typing in cmd on Windows. 
6. cd into the file folder/directory you want to save the project into (I recommend somewhere in your documents folder) cd means ‘change directory’ [ex. cd C:\Users\cv393\Documents for myself].
7. Type in ‘git clone https://github.com/cvs393/stylus_website.git’, or whatever the link was that you copied from github, then press enter
8. This will clone my github files into the folder you’re in (on cmd line) and now there are two copies of the code, one on the github site and one on your local computer. 
9. Do not push to my github (you won't be able to). Make a new repository with the name ‘stylus_website_20xx’ and then add all your files to it. Make changes to your own repository. 
10. When you want to push something to your new repository, 
  a. use 'git status', 
  b. then 'git add', 
  c. then 'git commit -m “something that describes what you did to your code”'
  d. and then 'git push' onto your own local repository. 

To view anything, simply open the html files with any web browser (chrome, firefox, etc) 
Have fun!
